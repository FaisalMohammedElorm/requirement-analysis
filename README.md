# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to exploring the process of **Requirement Analysis** in software development.  
Requirement analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that focuses on gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs of stakeholders.  

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Provide structured documentation on requirement analysis.  
- Share examples, templates, and case studies.  
- Serve as a learning resource for students and developers interested in understanding how requirements shape successful software projects.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It ensures that the system being built aligns with user requirements and business goals.  

### Importance in the SDLC
- Acts as the foundation for system design and development.  
- Minimizes misunderstandings between stakeholders, designers, and developers.  
- Reduces the risk of project failure by addressing requirements early in the lifecycle.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. **Clarity and Alignment**  
   Helps ensure that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the project goals.  

2. **Reduced Costs and Rework**  
   Identifies issues early, preventing expensive corrections later in the development phase.  

3. **Improved Quality**  
   Ensures that the final product meets user expectations and business objectives.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
- **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting initial information from stakeholders about system needs.  
- **Requirement Elicitation**: Engaging stakeholders through interviews, workshops, and surveys to refine requirements.  
- **Requirement Documentation**: Recording requirements in structured formats such as Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documents.  
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: Studying requirements to identify conflicts, overlaps, and gaps; using diagrams and models to visualize them.  
- **Requirement Validation**: Ensuring requirements are correct, complete, feasible, and testable before moving to design.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
These define what the system should do. They describe specific behaviors, functions, or services.  

**Booking Management System Examples:**  
- Users should be able to search for available rooms by date.  
- The system must allow users to book a room and receive a confirmation email.  
- Administrators should be able to add, update, or delete booking records.  

### Non-Functional Requirements
These define how the system performs a function, focusing on quality attributes.  

**Booking Management System Examples:**  
- The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.  
- Page load times must not exceed 3 seconds.  
- The system should comply with GDPR data protection regulations.

## Use Case Diagrams

**What are Use Case Diagrams?**  
Use Case Diagrams are a visual representation of the interactions between users (actors) and a system. They help stakeholders understand how different users will interact with the system and what functions the system must support.  

**Benefits:**  
- Provides a high-level view of system functionality.  
- Helps identify user roles and interactions.  
- Facilitates communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders.  

**Use Case Diagram for the Booking Management System:**  

Actors:  
- Customer  
- Administrator  
- Payment Gateway  

Use Cases:  
- Search Rooms  
- Book Room  
- Make Payment  
- Cancel Booking  
- Manage Bookings (Admin)

## Acceptance Criteria

**Importance of Acceptance Criteria**  
Acceptance Criteria are predefined conditions that a feature must satisfy to be considered complete. They ensure that the delivered functionality aligns with stakeholder expectations and is testable.  

**Example â€“ Checkout Feature in the Booking Management System:**  
- The system should display a summary of the booking (room type, dates, price).  
- Users must be able to enter payment details securely.  
- Payment should be processed via the integrated payment gateway.  
- A confirmation page must be displayed after successful payment.  
- A confirmation email must be sent to the customer with booking details.
